# The right way to write about graduates

#### How many people are we talking about?

##### 1 Person
* Is this person male or female?
     * Male
          * Use `alumnus` - it refers to a single male graduate
     * Female 
          * Use `alumna` - it refers to a single demale graduate

##### More than 1 person
* Is this a group of all women?
     * Use `alumnae` - it refers to a group of all female graduates
* Is this a group of all men or a mixed group of men and women?
     * Use `alumni` - it refers to a group of male graduates or a group of both make and female graduates
   

*But what about `alum` and `alums`?!*
You can also use `alum` to refer to an individual graduate, regardless of gender or `alums` to refer to a group of graduates regardless of its geneder make up.
